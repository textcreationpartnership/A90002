         <editorialDecl>
            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  <p>Why, I'le tell you, many Malignants are come into the City, and have made their peace with the Parliament by their Compo≈øitions; though they are as directly Royalli≈øts as ever they were: moreover, many Malignant Epi≈øcopall Prie≈øts are likewi≈øe by Compo≈øitions admitted into the City, both the one and the other, having cunning heads, choi≈øe wits, deep reaches, and malignant hearts, having ≈øome hopes that the Scots and the King will joyne together again≈øt the Parliament: (though
<pb n="7" facs="tcp:113648:4"/>for my part I have ≈øtrong confidence (what ever the Kings de≈øign may be) the Scots will appeare hone≈øt) the≈øe men well knowing that if they could but divide <hi>London</hi> from the Parliament, and get tho≈øe men ≈øuppre≈ø≈øed that have done them as much mi≈øchiefe as any in the Kingdome under the notion of Schi≈ømaticks, An<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nabapti≈øts, Independants and Sectaries, the≈øe men (I ≈øay may fo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment divi≈øions between the well-affected, and the City and Par<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>liament, not doubting but (if that was once irreconcileably done, what with the Scots, the Kings Party in the Kingdome &amp; Citie) the game would goe on their ≈øides, and ≈øo they have their de≈øires; Againe we have a great many Mini≈øters here, in and a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bout the Citie, ≈øome whereof doubtle≈ø≈øe in con≈øcience to the glory of God, being much affected with the divi≈øions and errours of the Times, others bya≈ø≈øed with ba≈øe ends of honour, and profit, the≈øe by their invective preachings, ≈øtirring up the Magi≈øtrates in their more popular Sermons at <hi>We≈øtmin≈øter, Pauls,</hi> every morning exerci≈øe in the Citie: as al≈øo by their bitter wri<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tings again≈øt tho≈øe that agree not with them in Church govern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment? and their di≈øper≈øions of their unchri≈øtian like bookes a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, ≈øuch as Ma≈øter <hi>Edwards</hi> bookes are (enough to ≈øet a whole Kingdome on fire) as al≈øo by the methods that are contriv'd by ≈øome, ≈øending abroad, and ≈øpreading their in≈øtructions, directi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ons, &amp; advice for the preaching on ≈øuch ≈øubjects throughout the Citie and Kingdome as people are not able to bear; whereby di<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vi≈øions, wrath, di≈øcord, and generall di≈øcontents are fomented throughout the Kingdome, ≈øetting Meni≈øter again≈øt people, and people again≈øt Mini≈øter, ≈øtirring up and provoking the City to be trouble≈øome to the Parliament, to petition againe and again, under a pretence of zeal for the hou≈øe of God, the glory of God, the reformation of the Kingdome, the ≈øetting up (and that with a rigorous exaction of uniformity therein) of that governement wherein indeed them≈øelves do not agree, ≈øome holding it <hi>Jure Divino,</hi> others <hi>Jure Humano,</hi> and ≈øo they make a great bu≈øling in the Citie and Kingdome about they know not what: hereupon it is very probable, for I ≈øpeake my thoughts, they ≈øtirre up the people to joyne with the Common Councell, and to ≈øtick unto them, in≈øinuating that the Parliament can do nothing without the Citie, and therefore petition: and if that will not do, peti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, and if that will not doe, petition againe and againe untill

                  <p>Why then by this kind of interpretation every man is bound to ≈øtrive to compell others to conformity unto that Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vernment, which hee ≈øuppo≈øeth to be according to the Word of God, and the example of the be≈øt Reformed Churches: ≈øo the Anabapti≈øt he is bound to compell others to his judgement: In<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dependants to do the like, ≈øeekers to do the like, and ≈øo this kind of expo≈øition of the Covenant, puts a ≈øword into the hands of all ≈øorts of Sectaries, and people of different judgments to rend and teare and devour one another, and what a dividing and dan<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gerous interpretation of the Covenant is this? to pre≈ø≈øe men as they tender a good con≈øcience to ruine one another.
